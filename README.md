Source files for 3D printers schematics (Libre Office Draw)
This repository contains most of the source files of vector schematics I published on RepRap Wiki or Duet/RRF documentation (See Aquilegia Repository).
File format is .odg (Libre Office Draw).
Content  may be a bit ahead of effectively published drawing and some drawings may not have been published elsewhere.
To help spread, there is a double licensing scheme with GFDL1.2   and CC BY-SA 3.0
